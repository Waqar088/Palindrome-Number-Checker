# Palindrome-Number-Checker
A C++ program that prompts the user to enter an integer number and checks whether it is a palindrome. A number is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward (e.g., 121, 1331). The program uses a while loop to reverse the number and compare it with the original.
